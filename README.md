# PollWidget
Poll widget created using React

# Technical choices
I used React for creating Poll Widget.
When Project run poll are visible on page load.

# For Testing 
Added one component under pages folder Poll.js (not added HTML static page). It will take one or multiple poll id as input and show respected Polls on page.
For that code is written in App.js file which is commented that need to uncomment and comment default pollData map code (because repeated polls will not load).
Code can be improved using router so that pages can be added in menu for same.

# Data Related
Polls data is added in data folder in pollData.json file

# Style and animation
For stying used Styled componets and animation is added to poll result bar.
